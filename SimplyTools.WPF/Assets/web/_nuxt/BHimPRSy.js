Effective Date: September 8, 2025

Welcome to SimplyAITools. This document outlines the policies governing the use of the built-in, on-device Artificial Intelligence (AI) features within our application. Your use of this application constitutes your acceptance of these policies.

1. Disclaimer & On-Device AI Processing
SimplyAITools is an open-source tool that utilizes browser-native, on-device AI models (such as Gemini Nano in Chrome and Phi-4-mini in Edge) to provide features like summarization.

We do not collect, transmit, or store any of the content you input into or the output you receive from these AI APIs. All processing of your data for these features happens locally on your device.

However, your use of these browser-based APIs may be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the browser vendor (e.g., Google or Microsoft). We encourage you to review their documentation for more details on their AI features and any data collection that may occur at the browser level.

2. Acceptable Use Policy
By using the AI features of SimplyAITools, you agree to the following conditions. This tool is provided for lawful and ethical purposes only.

You agree NOT to use this tool to:

Generate Harmful or Illegal Content: This includes, but is not limited to, content that promotes violence, hate speech, self-harm, harassment, or illegal acts.

Infringe on Intellectual Property Rights: You are solely responsible for ensuring that the content you input does not violate any copyright, trademark, patent, or other intellectual property rights. You may not use this tool to summarize content you are not authorized to access or use.

Create Defamatory or Misleading Content: Do not use the tool to generate summaries that are false, misleading, or defamatory towards any individual, group, or organization.

Process Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of Others: You must not input any sensitive or private information about other individuals. You are fully responsible for any such data you process.

Bypass Security or Access Controls: Do not use this tool in an attempt to circumvent security measures, licensing restrictions, or paywalls on websites or documents.

Train Competing Models: You may not use the output from this tool to train or improve any other AI models or services that are competitive with the browser's on-device AI capabilities.

3. User Responsibility and Liability
Sole Responsibility: You, the user, are solely responsible for any content you input into the application and for the use of any output generated by the AI features.

No Warranty: The AI features are provided on an "as-is" basis and are considered experimental. We make no warranties, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or safety of the generated output. The output may contain inaccuracies, biases, or errors.

Human Oversight: The output should not be treated as factual or professional advice. It is your responsibility to verify the accuracy of the output and to use it with human oversight.

Misuse: We are not liable for any damages, legal issues, or other consequences that arise from your misuse of this application or the AI features. We reserve the right to block access to our service for any user who violates these policies.

4. Your Privacy
Data Minimization: Our application is designed to be privacy-preserving. We do not collect or store any of the text content processed by the on-device AI APIs.

No Personal Data Collection: We do not collect any personal data, such as your IP address, browser information, or usage statistics, related to your use of the AI features.

Browser-Level Data: As mentioned, the browser vendor may have its own data collection practices related to the use of these APIs. We strongly recommend you review your browser's privacy policy to understand their data handling practices.

5. Policy Updates
We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes in the underlying technology or legal requirements. We will post a notice on this page if and when significant changes are made. Your continued use of the application after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.
